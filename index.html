        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Patrick is one proud older sibling to his younger brother, Jackson, as well as to his little sister, Mia.

            Jackson, who is three years younger than Patrick, has made a name for himself on TikTok and even detailed
            that it's nice to be known for something other than having a famous brother.

            "I'll never forget the first time that I was at a football game or at a store when people came up to me
            noticing me as Jackson from TikTok and not just Patrick Mahomes' brother," Jackson said during a vlog in
            September, per Life & Style.<br><br>
            Patrick has detailed his love of the condiment over the years and even signed an endorsement deal with
            Hunt's back in 2018.

            Ahead of Thanksgiving 2020, while appearing on KCSP 610 Sports Radio, Patrick also discussed how he uses
            ketchup on many food dishes, even telling the radio hosts he puts it on his turkey. "I mean you've gotta put
            ketchup on that. Turkey and ham!" he said.
